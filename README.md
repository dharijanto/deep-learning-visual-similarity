# Visual Similarity using Deep Learning


## fashion-images-feature-generation.ipynb

This is forked from a kaggle project [1]. Modified as the following:

- To work on different datasets more easily
- Applied PCA onto the resulting ResNet50-based feature-embedding,
  to reduce feature dimension from 2048 to 789
- Exported resulting feature vectors and similarity matrix into CSV
